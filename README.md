    utilise advanced technologies to monitor, control and 
    optimise the usage of energy in homes and
    businesses.By integrating sensor and smart meters
    and iot devices,these system provides real time data and
    automatic control to enhance energy efficiency .They
    enable users to track energy consumption, identified waste and
    make informed decisions to reduce cost and environmental impact
             Additionally smart energy management system supports renewable energy 
    integration and demand response strategies.overall it provides
    a sustainable and cost effective approach to energy use.
             The smart energy management system design using ESP8266 
   aurdino ide demonstrate an effective approach to optimising 
  energy consumption  The system wireless capabilities allow for remote
  monitoring and control provides user with convenience and 
  flexibility
